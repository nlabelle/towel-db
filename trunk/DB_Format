The database in towel-db is fairly simple.  Each record is a new file in the
database directory tree named with a key.  Within each record is a series of
entries, or columns.  Each column is started with this header:
%%[name]
Until the next header, everything is clustered into the body for that entry.
No typing is included, and all type conversion must be done manually.

_db is a reserved record name for various information about the database.
